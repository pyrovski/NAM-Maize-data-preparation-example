This is an example of SNP projection using NAM Maize data.

Run ./prepare.sh to prepare inputs for SNP projection.
This will remove column headers, combine imputed markers, and remove unused data columns for input to the Matlab projection script.

In Matlab, run projectAll to project SNPs for all chromosomes.
The resulting projected data files will be ~4 GB each.
